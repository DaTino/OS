If all of the stat() functions are taken out, the program will display the tree decently.
Had a lot of problems getting the program to work on hoar, I run the ubuntu subsystem on windows.
Getopt should work here, not sure if it will with the "current directory". I've been testing on the proj folder included.
Next one will be better.
